# Neocortex MK1 — Benchmarks

Benchmark tests and results for the Neocortex MK1 model (**id:** `mk1`). Base URL: `https://api.tinyhuman.xyz`.

## Setup

- **Gateway**: Neocortex/tinyhuman at `https://api.tinyhuman.xyz`
- **Model id**: `mk1` (see [README.md](README.md))

## Benchmark: Dummy latency (placeholder)

A minimal benchmark to validate the benchmark pipeline. It measures a no-op or trivial request path.

| Run     | Metric             | Value     | Unit |
| ------- | ------------------ | --------- | ---- |
| 1       | End-to-end latency | 12.3      | ms   |
| 2       | End-to-end latency | 11.8      | ms   |
| 3       | End-to-end latency | 12.1      | ms   |
| **Avg** | End-to-end latency | **12.07** | ms   |

_This is a placeholder. Replace with real benchmarks (e.g. `/health` or `/webhook` with a fixed payload) and re-run to populate._

## How to run (placeholder)

```bash
# Example: run dummy benchmark (implement as needed)
# ./scripts/bench-mk1.sh
```

Future: add scripts and real benchmark suites (e.g. latency percentiles, throughput, correctness) and link them here.
